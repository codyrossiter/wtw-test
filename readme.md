This directory contains the scripts for completing the tasks.

The scripts primarily use the python standard library but task_2.py
requires matplotlib to produce a time series chart.

A requirements file (requirements.txt) has been included for pip and virtualenv
installation.

After that, each script can be run via: `python task_X.py`
